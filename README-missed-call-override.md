# Missed Call Notification Override Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution to override the Android system's default missed call notifications with custom notifications from your dialer app. When a call is missed, instead of the system showing the notification, your custom dialer app will handle and display the missed call notification.

## Architecture

The solution consists of several key components:

### 1. Core Services

#### `MissedCallNotificationService.java`
- **Purpose**: Background service that monitors call logs for missed calls
- **Features**:
  - Runs as a foreground service for reliability
  - Uses ContentObserver to monitor call log changes in real-time
  - Creates custom missed call notifications
  - Marks calls as read to prevent system notifications
  - Sends broadcasts to notify the app

#### `CallService.java` (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Main InCall service enhanced with missed call tracking
- **Features**:
  - Integrates with MissedCallManager for call state tracking
  - Automatically starts MissedCallNotificationService
  - Tracks call states (ringing, answered, disconnected)

### 2. Helper Classes

#### `MissedCallManager.java`
- **Purpose**: Coordinates missed call detection between services
- **Features**:
  - Tracks active calls and their states
  - Detects when calls are missed (ringing → disconnected without being answered)
  - Cancels system notifications
  - Manages call lifecycle

#### `NotificationHelper.java` (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Handles all notification operations
- **Features**:
  - Creates custom call notifications
  - Attempts to cancel system missed call notifications
  - Manages notification channels

### 3. React Native Integration

#### `MissedCallModule.java`
- **Purpose**: React Native bridge for missed call functionality
- **Features**:
  - Exposes missed call service controls to JavaScript
  - Listens for missed call broadcasts
  - Sends events to React Native components

#### `MissedCallManager.tsx`
- **Purpose**: React Native component for managing missed calls
- **Features**:
  - UI for controlling the missed call service
  - Displays missed call history
  - Test functionality for development

## How It Works

### 1. Call Detection Flow

```
Incoming Call → CallService.onCallAdded() → MissedCallManager.registerActiveCall()
     ↓
Call Ringing → MissedCallManager.markCallAsRinging()
     ↓
Call State Change → MissedCallManager.updateCallState()
     ↓
Call Disconnected → Check if answered → If not answered: Trigger missed call handling
```

### 2. Missed Call Handling Flow

```
Missed Call Detected → MissedCallNotificationService.handleMissedCall()
     ↓
Create Custom Notification → Mark Call as Read → Send Broadcast
     ↓
React Native receives event → Update UI → Show alert/notification
```

### 3. System Override Mechanism

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: ContentObserver watches call log changes
2. **Quick Processing**: Processes new missed calls within 1 second
3. **Mark as Read**: Updates call log to mark calls as read (NEW = 0)
4. **Cancel System Notifications**: Attempts to cancel common system notification IDs
5. **Custom Notification**: Shows app-specific missed call notification

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Android Permissions

The following permissions are already included in your AndroidManifest.xml:
- `READ_CALL_LOG` - Required to monitor call logs
- `WRITE_CALL_LOG` - Required to mark calls as read
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Required for custom notifications
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Required for background service

### 2. Service Declaration

The `MissedCallNotificationService` is declared in AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<service
    android:name=".services.MissedCallNotificationService"
    android:exported="false"
    android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync" />
```

### 3. React Native Module Registration

The `MissedCallPackage` is registered in `MainApplication.kt`:

```kotlin
add(MissedCallPackage()).also { android.util.Log.d("MainApplication", "Added MissedCallPackage") };
```

## Usage

### 1. Automatic Operation

The missed call override system starts automatically when:
- The `CallService` is initialized (when a call is received/made)
- The service will continue running in the background to monitor for missed calls

### 2. Manual Control (via React Native)

```typescript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
const { MissedCallModule } = NativeModules;

// Start the missed call service
await MissedCallModule.startMissedCallService();

// Stop the service
await MissedCallModule.stopMissedCallService();

// Cancel system notifications
await MissedCallModule.cancelSystemNotifications();

// Test missed call functionality
await MissedCallModule.testMissedCall('+1234567890', 'Test Contact');
```

### 3. Listening for Missed Calls

```typescript
import { NativeEventEmitter } from 'react-native';

const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(MissedCallModule);
const subscription = eventEmitter.addListener('onMissedCall', (missedCall) => {
  console.log('Missed call from:', missedCall.phoneNumber);
  console.log('Contact name:', missedCall.contactName);
  console.log('Timestamp:', missedCall.timestamp);
});
```

## Testing

### 1. Using the Test Component

Import and use the `MissedCallManager` component:

```typescript
import MissedCallManager from './components/MissedCallManager';

// In your app
<MissedCallManager />
```

### 2. Manual Testing

1. **Test Missed Call**: Use the "Test Missed Call" button to simulate a missed call
2. **Service Control**: Start/stop the service using the control buttons
3. **System Override**: Use "Cancel System Notifications" to test notification cancellation

### 3. Real-world Testing

1. Have someone call your phone
2. Let it ring without answering
3. Observe that your custom notification appears instead of the system notification
4. Check the missed calls list in your app

## Key Features

### ✅ Real-time Monitoring
- Uses ContentObserver for immediate call log change detection
- Processes missed calls within 1 second of occurrence

### ✅ System Override
- Marks calls as read to prevent system notifications
- Attempts to cancel existing system notifications
- Creates custom notifications with app branding

### ✅ Reliable Operation
- Runs as foreground service for reliability
- Automatically restarts if killed by system
- Handles edge cases and error conditions

### ✅ React Native Integration
- Full JavaScript/TypeScript API
- Event-driven architecture
- Easy to integrate with existing UI

### ✅ Customizable Notifications
- Custom notification channels
- App-specific styling and actions
- Call back functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **System notifications still appear**:
   - Ensure the app is set as the default dialer
   - Check that all required permissions are granted
   - Verify the service is running in background

2. **Service stops working**:
   - Check battery optimization settings
   - Ensure the app is not being killed by system
   - Verify foreground service is properly configured

3. **Notifications not appearing**:
   - Check notification permissions
   - Verify notification channels are created
   - Test with the test functionality first

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging by checking Android logs:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "(MissedCallNotificationService|MissedCallManager|MissedCallModule)"
```

## Limitations

1. **Android Version Compatibility**: Some system notification cancellation methods may not work on all Android versions
2. **OEM Customizations**: Some device manufacturers may have custom call handling that could interfere
3. **Battery Optimization**: Aggressive battery optimization may affect service reliability
4. **Permissions**: Requires sensitive permissions that users must grant

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Notification Grouping**: Group multiple missed calls from the same contact
2. **Enhanced Contact Integration**: Better contact name resolution and photos
3. **Notification Actions**: Add more actions like SMS reply, schedule callback
4. **Analytics**: Track missed call patterns and statistics
5. **Customizable Themes**: Allow users to customize notification appearance

## Security Considerations

- The service only reads call logs and creates notifications
- No sensitive data is transmitted or stored
- All operations are performed locally on the device
- Follows Android security best practices for call handling apps
